Here's how to make your music playlist that you can easily share with friends, enemies, family, or a media industry agent.

1. Remix this project using the "Remix to Edit" button in the top right corner.
2. Delete the mp3 files in the `assets` folder and upload your own music.
3. Update the `tracklist.json` file with links to your uploaded music and song titles. You can see the URL of your songs by clicking each file.
